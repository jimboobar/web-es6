# web-es6
A lightweight code base to interactively work with the DOM-tree using *Webpack* and *ES6*, Maybe not the perfect way, but hopefully an easy way.

## Get started
Clone the repository, open a terminal and run the following commands.
```
npm install
npm run start
```
Open [http://localhost:8080/] and code away!

## Start coding
Let's make some small changes in *src/main.js* and watch the changes in the browser.

## Get advanced
Now try to make a component of your own, maybe a *list* or *input* component?

## TODO - Components
* Http calls
* Data Storage
* Data Service
* Graphics stuff (canvas or WebGL maybe)
